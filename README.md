# MNIST-Predictor
In this project I solved the classic machine learning problem of MNIST using a LeNet Convolutional Nueral Network. This network architecture is suited to predicting characters, so it was an ideal choice for this project. Using a the model we get a 99% accuracy on the training data and a 98% accuracy on the test data after the model has been fully trained.
